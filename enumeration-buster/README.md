## üìú Description

This bash script automates the process of **directory enumeration** for a given URL using a wordlist. It attempts to find valid directories by making HTTP requests and checking the responses. The script supports basic verbosity, showing the HTTP response codes and the status of each directory being tested.

It‚Äôs designed to assist penetration testers and security researchers with the discovery of hidden or restricted directories on web servers. The script outputs the found directories and provides real-time feedback about the status of each attempt.

## üß† Usage

### **Basic Usage:**

```bash
$ ./directory_enumeration.sh -u <url> -w <wordlist>
```

**-u <url>**: The base URL for the directory enumeration (e.g., http://example.com).

**-w <wordlist>**: Path to the wordlist file containing directory names to test.

**-v**: (Optional) Enable verbose mode, which shows HTTP response codes and the URLs being tested.

Example:
```bash
$ ./directory_enumeration.sh -u http://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

This will test all directories in the wordlist against the provided URL.

**Verbose Mode:**
To enable verbose output, use the -v flag. This will display HTTP status codes for each request.

```bash
$ ./directory_enumeration.sh -u http://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -v
```
